## Team reflection

#### What went well?

Our app is a true representation of what we had planned at the beginning of the project, the filters are functional, the map allows users to select the country and the charts show the top 5 years, as well as the line plot containing the medal count by year.

#### What changed?

In the first tab we added a bar chart showing the medal count by type, we believe that this information is valuable for users, replacing the chart we had planned would show the top 5 sports that have contributed the most to the medal count of a country (since this is displayed in tab 2). A significant change to the dashboard is that we added a tab displaying the medal count by sport, in a tabular and graphical way.

#### Future improvements

- In the second tab, we can add a filter by sport and display the medal count by sports event, not by sport, adding more granularity.

- The line plot does not show anything if there is just 1 medal which makes sense but maybe we can think of any a different visualization.

- In the second tab both the table and the treemap are different representations of the same data, maybe we should replace one of them.

- Change the x-axis spacing in the line plot to 4 years since that is the time interval between games, or to 2 years if both game seasons are selected.
