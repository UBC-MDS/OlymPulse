## Team reflection

#### What all have we included/implemented in the app?

We feel our app has useful plots and widgets that can help the user derive useful insights. The widgets and map enable the user to filter and drill down to specific year, sport and event of a country. On the first tab, the bar plots allow to see countries’ medal tally and the line plot enables to see the trend in performance over time. The second tab allows the users to drill deeper to see the performance in different sports and events.


#### Future improvements

We believe that our app is production grade. All widgets and reactive elements work properly. Further We have taken the into consideration various feedback provided by reviewers to make it ready to be deployed into production. In the future we might add more visualization in different tabs, perhaps to show medal stats by demographic factors like age, sex etc.

#### How has the user experience been for our app based on feedback received?

The feedback from the reviewers of our app suggests that it is user-friendly and very intuitive to use. The filters and widgets have been well labelled and the graphs have appropriate labels and titles as well, making it easier for users to follow what the dashboard is aiming to show. We have also included an animation in our Readme which shows users how to navigate the app which perhaps helped them in making the app easier to use.  A user pointed out it was difficult for them to see that the app had multiple pages straight away so we added a colour to the background of the tab names.  

#### Are there any recurring themes in the feedback?

There were some suggestions to add certain elements to the app but there was no common theme in the suggestions. However, given the limited time available to develop the app, we decided to make improvements based on the suggestions that would be most useful in making the app but visually and functionally better.

#### Feedback that we found most valuable to improve our app
We received some feedback to improve the aesthetics of the app which we implemented. For example -
- Increased the font size of the plot axess and the titles
- Matched the colour of the bars with the medal’s colours (gold/ silver/ bronze)
- Changed the axis labels for the plots so that the x-axes only have integers 
- Added numbers on the bar charts so they’re more straightforward to read
as well as other aesthetic changes. Together these changes have made the app look much better and visually appealing. 

In addition to this, we made some functional changes based on suggested feedback. A important suggestion that we received and further incorporated is to dynamically update the dropdown menus based on the year selected in the slider widget on each page as there are countries that did not take part in the Olympics in certain years.
