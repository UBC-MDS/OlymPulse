## Expectations

#### *Work Distribution*

To ensure that work will be distributed in a fair and equitable manner, the team will use Github project boards to outline the various tasks for each week and assign individual team members to each task. Some tasks may require more than one team member to complete, in which case several names may be assigned to the task. Regardless of who is responsible for the task, team members may reach out to the group for assistance at any time.  All tasks are expected to be completed with high-quality and sufficiently detailed explanations where needed.  

#### *Time and Deadlines*
It is expected that each team member will work on the project for at least 8 hours every week. This can include the time spent working on the project during team meetings, outlined below. The tasks assigned to each team member should be completed by a self-designated deadline. If a team member has difficulty finishing a task within this deadline, they should give the team at least 24 hours' notice, or by the Friday night before the project submission deadline, at the latest. The remaining work may then be re-distributed among the team members for completion. The self-designated deadline should be Friday night at 10pm at the latest. The group deadline for submitting the assignment is Saturday at 6pm.

#### *Pull Requests*

All changes and additions to the project must be made through pull requests. All team members are expected to create, and review pull requests in the GitHub repository, and all pull requests should be reviewed within 48 hours of creation.

#### *Group Meetings*

Group meetings will take place at the following times every week:
- Tuesdays, 2-5pm (in-person, during the weekly lab sessions and for one hour afterwards)
- Fridays, 2-3pm (online using zoom/slack) 
- Ad-hoc meetings, when necessary, to be recorded in GitHub issues.  

Ad-hoc meetings may occur anytime during the week except the following times: 
- Weekdays post 11 PM 
- Saturday post 6 PM 
- Sunday 

It is expected that during the Friday meetings, team members will provide stand-up reports to update the team on current progress, planned next steps, and any issues that other team members can help resolve. This may also be done on GitHub issues or through Slack.\

### *Communications*

Communications outside of team meetings will take place informally on Slack, and formally using GitHub issues.Any breaches in contract will first result in a discussion of the behavior with the team member. Further breaches will result in team discussions, followed by escalation to the TAs or professors if necessary
